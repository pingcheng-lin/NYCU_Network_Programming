## Project 1 
> Score: 100

In this project, you are asked to design a shell named npshell.

## Project 2 
> Score: 94

In this project, you are asked to design 3 kinds of servers:
1. Design a Concurrent connection-oriented server. This server allows one client connect to it.
2. Design a server of the chat-like systems, called remote working systems (rwg). In this system, users can communicate with other users. You need to use the single-process concurrent paradigm to design this server.
3. Design the rwg server using the concurrent connection-oriented paradigm with shared memory and FIFO.
These three servers must support all functions in project 1.

## Project 3 
> Score: 100

The project is divided into two parts.
1. Write a simple HTTP server called http server and a CGI program console.cgi.
2. Provides the same functionality as part 1, but with some rules slightly differs: Implement one program, cgi server.exe, which is a combination of http server, panel.cgi, and console.cgi. Your program should run on Windows 10.

## Project 4 
> Score: 100

Implement the SOCKS 4/4A protocol in the application layer of the OSI model.
